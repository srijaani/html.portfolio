<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>Hi everyone, my name is Srijani Kangsabanik. I'm originally from Nabadwip, Nadia, but currently live in Kolkata. I'm passionate about Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning, which is why I'm pursuing a B.Tech degree in AIML at Narula Institute of Technology.
  </p>

  <p>While academics are important, I also have a deep love for the arts. Throughout my school years, I attended Holy Child KG School in Nabadwip for my 4th standard, followed by Nabadwip Tarasundari Girls' High School for my 10th and 12th standards.
  </p>
  
 <p> Beyond academics, I've actively cultivated my artistic side. I've dedicated four years to learning Rabindra Nrittya and Kathak dance forms at Bangiya Sur Sangeet Kendra. Additionally, I've honed my skills in drawing and even completed my first grade in Piano!
</p>
  
  <p>I'm excited to be here and eager to learn and grow in this field. Perhaps there are others here who share my interests in AI and the arts? It would be great to connect!</p>
